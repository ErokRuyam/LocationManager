# LocationManager
The Class return in Swift to get updated locations in any state of application(like Active, Background, Suspended Or Teminated).
Location Manager is Singleton class, helpful to get updated locations. 

Here, I have created a sample demo project named 'LocationUpdate' which uses LocationManager and saves the locations into .plist file.
